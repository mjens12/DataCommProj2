# DataCommProj2
This project is designed to implement a P2P marketplace using a centralized server as part of the architecture.
The application consists of two parts, the server that handles the coordination between clients, and the client itself that communicates with the server and with the other clients.
The marketplace itself allows clients to post items that they wish to sell and allows other clients to search for specific items listed.
Each individual client tracks its available funds and okays any purchases with the other client based on those available funds.
